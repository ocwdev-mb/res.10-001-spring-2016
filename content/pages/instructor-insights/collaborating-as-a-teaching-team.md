{{< quote "It’s very important for people on the teaching team to feel that they own a piece of the course." "— Felice Frankel" >}}

I had an amazing team of five people helping me facilitate the course. Even though it was an enormous time commitment (it was not a 9 to 5 job, as we had to be available all the time due to the global audience for the course), we still occasionally write to each other, and say, “I miss this.”

I've never collaborated this deeply before, and it's changed my view of my work. I learned that I don't have all the answers. Although I made some executive decisions in the course, I didn’t dictate to people. I think it's very important for people on the teaching team to feel that they own a piece of the course, that their suggestions are very seriously taken. You must give people the opportunity to express their ideas. It's critical. And trust them. I believe that we all felt ownership at some level.

In the end, the team made this learning experience work. There is no question about it.
